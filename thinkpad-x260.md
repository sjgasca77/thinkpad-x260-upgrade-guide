# Thinkpad ultimate guide x260

## 1. Why Lenovo X260?

As you may know Thinkpad laptops are recognised for its durability and military grade specs (MIL-STD-810G).

Among all Thinkpad series, the T series and X series are the most renowned [Wikipedia Thinkpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad). I have owned another models which are iconic like Thinkpad T420 and Thinkpad T440p, the latest being recognised as one of the most upgradeable laptops ever (at least for Lenovo brand).

However T series is focused for performance laptops with considerable weight: 
current T490 weights 1,55 Kgs, while T440p weights 2,1 Kgs. While this shouldn't be an issue for someone who needs a performance laptop, it is too bulky and heavy for daily use.

I wanted a "modern" laptop (at least with a USB3.0 port) and X260 is the best choice in the lighter X series laptops. Here there's a comparison of several famous X series laptops regarding aspects I am interested.
