# Thinkpad ultimate guide x260

## 1. Why Lenovo X260?

As you may know Thinkpad laptops are recognised for its durability and military grade specs (i.e. MIL-STD-810G).

Among all Thinkpad series, the T series and X series are the most renowned [Thinkpads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad). I have owned another models which are iconic like Thinkpad T420 and Thinkpad T440p, the latest being recognised as one of the most upgradeable laptops ever (at least for Lenovo brand).

However T series is focused for performance laptops with considerable weight: 
current T490 weights 1,55 Kgs, while T440p weights 2,1 Kgs. While this shouldn't be an issue for someone who needs a performance laptop, it is too bulky and heavy for daily use.

I wanted a "modern" laptop (at least with a USB3.0 port) and X260 is the best choice in the lighter X series laptops. Here there's a comparison of several famous X series laptops regarding aspects I am interested.


|Model | Rel. year |Max RAM |RAM Tp.|RAM slots|USB |Charge connector| Comments
|------|-----------|--------|-------|---------|----|----------------|-------
|X220  | 2011 (Apr)| 8GB    | DDR3  | 2       |2.0 |                | Iconic model
|X230  | 2012 (May)| 8GB    | DDR3  | 2       |3.0 |                |  
|X240  | 2013      | 8GB    | DDR3  | 1       |3.0 |Yellow USB sq.  |
|X250  | 2015      | 16GB   | DDR3  | 1       |3.0 |Yellow USB sq.  | RAM 16GB expens.
|X260  | 2016      | 32GB   | DDR4  | 1       |3.0 |Yellow USB sq.  |
|X270  | 2017      | 32GB   | DDR4  | 1       |3.0 |Yellow USB sq.  | USB-C connector
|X280  | 2018      | 16GB   | DDR4  | 1       |3.0 |USB-C           |


As you can see on the table above, modern laptop can be considered from X240 onwards (USB3.0). I'm not interested on an USB2.0 only laptop. On the RAM side, 8 Gb is pretty much the standard today, but it is interested that you can expand it. X250 admits one stick of DDR3 RAM but getting 16GB of DDR3 on one stick is very expensive (~150-200 €) which it is as expensive as second hand laptop itself.

Regarding charge connector, I had a T480s which was charging with USB-C and I really don't like. USB-C connector got loose with frequent use and it seemed not very sturdy. Yellow square connector is the right one.

Finally, between X260 and X270 there's not much difference: graphic card goes from Intel HD Graphics 520 to Intel HD Graphics 620, X270 has one USB-C instead of mini display port that is present on X260 (for multiple monitors). 

So let's go for Thinkpad X260!

## 2. Tips for buying on eBay

Despite you can buy refurbished laptops like Thinpad on Amazon, I recommend getting one on EBay. You can find them cheaper and more variety. Before checking offers on EBay, you need to consider two aspects of the laptop you want: processor model and screen resolution. You can see the different models on the table below, based on [X260 platform specs](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_X260/ThinkPad_X260_Spec.PDF).

|Processor|# cores|# threads|Freq.  |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
|i3-6060U |2      |4        |2.0 GHz|
|i3-6100U |2      |4        |2.3 GHz|
|i5-6200U |2      |4        |2.3 GHz|
|i5-6300U |2      |4        |2.4 GHz|
|i7-6500U |2      |4        |2.5 GHz|
|i7-6600U |2      |4        |2.6 GHz|

Display types can make a difference in price:

|Size (in)|Resolution     |Technology|Brightness |
|---------|---------------|----------|-----------|
|12.5"    |1366x768 (HD)  |TN        |200 nits   |
|12.5"    |1366x768 (HD)  |IPS       |300 nits   |
|12.5"    |1920x1080 (FHD)|IPS       |300 nits   |

Another components that may increase price on eBay are RAM (8Gb or 16Gb), hard disk size, backlit keyboard and general condition: broken LCD screen, external battery and charger included, and so on. Choose lower specs first if you have the option.

I recommend you get an i5 or i7 CPU since CPU is soldered and cannot be upgraded later. LCD panels are very bad in these laptops in general. Get an IPS panel instead of TN technology. You can buy an item with bad screen and replace it later. 

Regarding the purchase on ebay. Some considerations:

* Choose professional seller first. This way you make sure item is in good condition: it powers on, is reliable, etc. Choose items on auction first and later check items with fixed price. You will find mostly i5 processors, but you can specifically search for i7, FHD screen or some specification.

* If you live in European Union, avoid UK sellers you may have to pay a lot of taxes which will ruin your bargain. Also avoid USA sellers (notice that shipping cost may exceed product cost). Germany and Italy professional sellers are usually fine. 


## 3. Upgrading the basics

The basic parts you will probably have to upgrade or change when you receive the laptop are:

* **Keyboard**. Usually you will get a foreigner keyboard with strange letters. Despite it seems a detail, you get easily fed up of guessing keys correspond to which symbol on a foreigner keyboard. You have two options: buy local keyboard or buy stickers with key letters.

* **RAM**. Buy a laptop with 8Gb of RAM and upgrade it to 16Gb.

* **Hard disk**. Laptop usually comes with an SSD disk, but buying a new one instead of refurbished one makes the difference.

* **Battery**. X260, as other X series laptops, has 2 batteries. Internal or external batteries should be worn. Consider replacing any of them, but first we will check the number of cicles and battery percentage before replacing them.

* **LCD screen**. Consider replacing if screen is HD resolution.
